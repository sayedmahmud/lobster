<h2>
<a id="1-description" class="anchor" href="#1-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1 DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p>LOBster was designed to run on a gobook or netbook to alleviate errors in DFing
Lines of Bearing (LOBs) from multiple sites inherent in human plotting
(specifically on maps of 1:50000) by attempting to simplify the collation of
multiple LOBs from one or more non-colocated collection sites.</p>

<p>The next logical evolution which I have not got around to developing (and probably
will not for the forseeable future) is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>use gps devices to ascertain the current position (allowing sites to move
without manually entering the new location)</li>
<li>implement an adhoc wireless network automating the entry of LOBs from other
sites without requiring some external communication method and manual entry</li>
<li>downloadable maps and local tileserver (the area this this program was tested
in did not have freely available maps of quality)</li>
</ul>

<p>This program (as is) has been tested and applied in real-world situations with
success.</p>
