REQUIREMENTS: \r\n * linux (preferred 3.x kernel) tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04\r\n * Python 2.7\r\n * Tix 8.4.3, tk, tk-dev\r\n * mgrs 1.1\r\n * matplotlib 1.3.1 (Note: after updating to matplotlib 1.4.3, basemap 'broke'\r\n   and had to fall back to older version\r\n   NOTE:\r\n   to use images map window, take the *.ppm files\r\n    erase.ppm  labels.ppm  quadrant.ppm  separator.ppm\r\n   located in img/navbar & copy to /usr/share/matplotlib/mpl-data/images\r\n * basemap 1.07","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
